            <p>I work as a full-stack developer in Cairo. I love creating dynamic, original things from beginning to end. I enjoy creating websites and apps with purpose. My speciality is turning complicated concepts into elegant, simple, and useful interfaces. I specialises in creating websites and applications with advanced features that call for particular solutions. I've had the opportunity to collaborate with a variety of talented teams on a wide range of intriguing projects, and I'm always up for new challenges!</p>
            <br/>
            <p>With over 2 years of experience in software development and have worked on a variety of projects. Using technology like TypeScript, React, Redux, Next.js, Ruby on Rails, Shopify, etc.,  I enjoy building complex applications that require thoughtful architectural design, state management and performances, combined to a slick User Experience. I'm constantly searching for the most effective, quickest, and cleanest way to construct the product. I pay particular attention to performances and accessibility. I've recently become interested in areas like AI, decentralised applications, and sustainable web development.</p>
