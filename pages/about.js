            <p>Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer based in Cairo. I enjoy building dynamic, creative products from start to finish. I love building apps and websites with a meaning. Transforming complex ideas into simple, beautiful and functional interfaces is my thing. I specialise in building applications and websites with advanced features that require specific solutions. I've had the opportunity to work on a range of exciting projects with many different talented teams, and I'm always up for new challenges!</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Within more than 2 years of experience in software development, I have been working on various products. I built numerous projects using tech like TypeScript, React, Redux, Next.js, Ruby on Rails, Shopify, ... I enjoy building complex applications that require thoughtful architectural design, state management and performances, combined to a slick User Experience. I'm always looking for the fastest, cleanest and most efficient way to build the product. I give special attention to accessibility and performances. Lately I have been interested in topics like AI, decentralised applications or sustainable web development.</p>
